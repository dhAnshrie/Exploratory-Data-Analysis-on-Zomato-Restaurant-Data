<H2>Project Highlights:</H2>

Data Analysis: Analyzed key metrics such as ratings, votes, and cost per plate to identify trends and correlations.
Visualizations: Created various visualizations including bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps to represent data distributions and relationships.
Insights: Derived actionable insights about factors influencing restaurant ratings and customer behavior.
Recommendations: Provided data-driven recommendations for improving restaurant ratings and customer engagement on the Zomato platform.


**Key Features:**
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis, handling missing values and outliers.
Interactive Visualizations: Used Seaborn and Matplotlib to create detailed visual representations of the data.
Correlation Analysis: Performed a correlation analysis to explore the relationships between different numerical variables.


**How to Use:**
Notebooks: The Jupyter notebooks in this repository contain the full code and analysis.
Data Source: Due to GitHub's file size limitations, the dataset is not included in this repository. You can download the dataset from this link ((https://www.kaggle.com/code/akshitmadan/zomato-data-set-analysis-visualization)).


**Future Work:**
Expand the analysis to include additional factors like cuisine types and delivery times.
Develop predictive models based on the insights gained from the EDA.
